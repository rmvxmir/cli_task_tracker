## CLI Task Tracker

A simple command-line tool to help you manage your tasks, created with Python and Click. The CLI Task Tracker allows you to add, update, delete, list, and manage the progress status of your tasks. Tasks are saved in a JSON file (`data.json`) for persistent storage, making it easy to keep track of tasks between sessions.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Add a new task with a description.
- **Update a Task**: Update an existing task's description.
- **Delete a Task**: Delete a task by its ID.
- **Mark In Progress**: Mark a task as in-progress.
- **Mark Done**: Mark a task as done.
- **List Tasks**: List all tasks or filter by status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
